/**
 * Design an artificial nightmare of offices, corridors, forms, and waiting queues.(???)
 * Start by the smallest cog in this vast bureaucratic machine: the Bureaucrat. (????)
 * A Bureaucrat must have a constant name, a grade from 1 to 150. 1 is the highest possible grade. (V)
 * Throw an exception (Bureaucrat::GradeTooHighException OR Bureaucrat::GradeTooLowException) on any attempt to instantiate a Bureaucrat using an invalid grade.
 * Implement getName() and getGrade()
 * Implement two member functions to increment or decrement the bureaucrat grade
 * If the grade is out of range, both of them will throw the same exceptions as the constructor.
 * Implement an overload of the insertion (Â«) operator to print something like (without the angle brackets): <name>, bureaucrat grade <grade>
 * Turn in some tests to prove everything works as expected.
